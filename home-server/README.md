Next to peer-to-peer, setting up a home server is also a great way to improve our digital sovereignty.

## NAS

One of the possibilities is to extend the capabilities of Network Attached Storage (NAS), you know: a device that is plugged in to the home network and provides a network drive to laptops and desktops in the home.

Many of these NAS systems can run arbitrary Docker-containers nowadays. These Docker-containers can provide all kinds of services that can compete with services that can be obtained from the cloud.

As an alternative to buying a plug-and-play NAS (e.g., from Synology or QNAP), it is also possible to assemble a PC and run free, open source, Linux-based NAS software on it (e.g., [TrueNAS Scale](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-community-edition/))

## Raspberry Pi

Another way to set up a home-server is by running it on a Raspberry Pi. The fun is that this is a very small box that can just lie around on the shelf next to the internet modem.

I found a nice [blog post](https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-server-starting-guide/) that explains how to do just that. It is on my todo list (but not at the top).
